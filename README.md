# Re-schema-form
## Rescript form render
Re-schema-form is a meta based render.  This can be especially useful for generating large forms with predefined templates. That is, we want to generate a form based on some kind of scheme. But at the same time, we do not want to describe the circuit separately and separately have the type. **ppx** is in my opinion the best solution for this

### Features
 
 First of all!  This idea is not new. https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form
 But the main difference is that in rjsf we must define the FormData type and also describe the schema itself. **BUT** in react-schema-form we should define only our type (form data type)
 
```rescript
module StateSchema = %schema(
  type schema_meta = {name: string}
  type app = {
    first_field: string,
    second_field: int
  }
);
``` 

Also take a look at this https://github.com/Astrocoders/lenses-ppx project for a better understanding of how ppx works. In addition, the generation of lenses is borrowed from there
